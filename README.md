Getting And Cleaning Data 
=============================
Course Project
=============================


To run the script make sure that:

1. You have the script in the root of your working directory
2. There is a "data" folder where the Samsung data has been uncompressed. In other words, "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/" must exist and have the necessary data
3. after running the script, the result tidyData.txt will be put in the same data directory and the memory will be free.
4. Keep in mind that if you want to analyze the objects created during exectution, the instruction to free the memory at the end must be skipped (either deleted or commented)
